        Hello! My name is Vedika Agarwal. I am a student of Delhi Public School, Noida of class 8th. I am a person who
        tries to be positive about every aspect of life.<br>
        This website helps introduce people to the fun and exciting ways to make origami, and try it out themselves too. <br>
        Origami is an ancient art form that is believed to have been around for nearly 2000 years,
        derived from the Japanese tradition of paper-folding. <br>
